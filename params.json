{"name":"Install mongo db as service","tagline":"Script to install mongodb as a service with one click","body":"### Why we need a script to install mongo db as a service?\r\nMongo db is a great tool, but after you install it is not installed as a service. That means you need to run it every time you need or install as a service once following this [tutorial](https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/).\r\nIt is not a complicate procedure, but it need some time to understand commands and run them. This script allow you to perform an installation just with one click.\r\n\r\n### How to install mongo db as a service\r\n_First off all download and install mongo db. You can pick last version and run the wizard as usual._\r\n\r\nDouble click on \"InstallAsService.ps1\" and follow wizard. **That's all, folks ;-)**\r\nDuring wizard will be asked for settings, each of them comes with a default value so you just need to press \"next\" \"next\" \"next\" if you dont'mind to customize installation.\r\n\r\n[You can download \"InstallAsService.ps1\" script here](https://github.com/zeppaman/install-mongo-db-as-service/blob/master/InstallAsService.ps1)\r\n\r\n\r\n### PowerShell says “execution of scripts is disabled on this system.”\r\nDont worry it is normal. Powershell doesn' allow you to run script by \"double click\" by deafult. What you can do:\r\nOpen a powershell shell, then navigate to folder and launch script using following command:\r\n\r\n    PowerShell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\\InstallAsService.ps1\r\n\r\nOr change powershell execution policy to \"Unrestricted\" by runnning powershell in elevate permission and type:\r\n\r\n    Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted\r\n\r\nBefore follow secondo option, please check any possible security issue.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThis script is bundled by @zeppaman  and inspired from a stack overflow thread. \r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Script?
